// Given an array 'arr' of integer numbers. where 'arr[i]' represents the number
//  of pages in the 1- th' book. There are 'm' number of students and the task is to 
//  allocate all the books to their students. Allocate books in such a way that:

// 1. Each student gets at least one book.

// 2. Each book should be allocated to a student.

// 3. Book allocation should be in a contiguous manner.

// You have to allocate the book to 'm' students such that the maximum number of pages
//  assigned to a student is minimum.

// Example:

// Let's consider 'n=4' (number of books) and 'm-2' (number of students).

// 'arr = (10, 20, 30, 40 )'.
